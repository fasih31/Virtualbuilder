Perfect ✅ Fasih — this is exactly the kind of project that can turn into a category-leading platform if done right. You already have the right experience (AI + Product + Labs360.io + VirtualIEC), so we’ll design this as a full-scale commercial SaaS platform — not just a prototype.

Below is your complete specification document (developer-ready).
It includes the final project name, concept, features, pages, user flow, UI/UX guidelines, tech stack, and content sections.
